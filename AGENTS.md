# Agent contract

Steward has no governance package to hook into — it has zero dependency on
anything private, including the tooling that enforces discipline on its sibling
repos. This document is the substitute: read it before changing code, the same
way you would read a generated `AGENTS.md` elsewhere, except here the guard is
your own discipline plus CI, not a pre-write hook.

## The one invariant that must never regress

**Zero dependency, at build time or runtime, on any private package, API, or
tool.** This is the entire reason Steward is a separate, public repository —
see [README.md](README.md#zero-private-dependencies). Before any commit:

```console
$ go list -m all
github.com/hardrails/steward
```

must list only this module. If a change makes this list grow, stop and ask
whether that dependency is actually necessary — the Go standard library covers
everything this service needs today (HTTP server, JSON, mutex-guarded maps,
structured logging via `log/slog`). Do not import a web framework, a
third-party router, or any SDK. Do not add a dependency to make a task
marginally more convenient; the whole point of this repo is that a sovereign
operator with zero trust in any vendor can clone it alone and build it.

## Before you commit

Run what CI runs, locally, first — CI failing is a review comment landing
minutes late instead of seconds:

```console
gofmt -l .          # must be empty
go vet ./...
go build ./...
go test -race ./...
```

A pre-commit hook that runs exactly this exists at `.githooks/pre-commit`.
Enable it once per clone: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. `main` is
branch-protected — `build / vet / test`, `golangci-lint`, and `openapi lint`
must all pass before a PR can merge, and force-pushes/deletions are blocked —
so a bypassed local hook does not mean bad code reaches `main`, only that it
takes longer to find out.

## Invariants specific to this codebase

These exist because a reviewer already found and fixed the failure mode once
(see git history / the PR that introduced each). Don't reintroduce them:

- **Every request body is bounded.** `http.MaxBytesReader` wraps every decode
  in `internal/server`. An unbounded body on an unauthenticated-by-design
  service is a one-request OOM — this was found, empirically reproduced (a
  64 MiB body drove RSS from ~12 MB to ~268 MB), and fixed. Any new endpoint
  that reads a body must bound it the same way.
- **The instance tracker has a capacity cap.** `internal/runtime.Tracker` takes
  a `maxInstances` and returns `ErrCapacityExceeded` (mapped to HTTP 503) once
  a *new* instance would exceed it. Don't remove the cap or make it
  effectively unbounded — an unauthenticated loop of distinct `instance_id`s
  is the same OOM shape as the body-size issue, just via instance count
  instead of bytes.
- **The server sets `ReadTimeout`/`WriteTimeout`/`IdleTimeout`**, not just
  `ReadHeaderTimeout`. Headers-fast-then-slow-body is a real DoS shape on an
  unauthenticated service; don't drop these when touching `cmd/steward/main.go`.
- **Every map access in `internal/runtime` is inside the tracker's single
  mutex.** No check-then-act window between reading `byID`/`byRef` and
  mutating them — that's exactly the shape a double-provision or a
  zombie-resurrection-after-destroy bug would take. If you touch this file,
  the concurrency test (`TestConcurrentProvisionCreatesOnlyOne`, run with
  `-race`) must still pass, and stay meaningful — don't loosen it to make a
  change easier.
- **`Provision` is idempotent on `instance_id`**, and that idempotency is
  scoped to the instance's lifetime, not global: `Destroy` releases the id for
  reuse, so a `Provision` after a `Destroy` creates a new, unrelated instance
  with a fresh `runtime_ref` (documented on `Destroy` itself — read that
  comment before changing either function).
- **Every error response is the same JSON shape**
  (`{"error": "...", "message": "..."}`), including the stdlib mux's default
  404/405 (rewritten by `jsonErrors` middleware) and a recovered panic
  (`recoverMiddleware`, → 500). `openapi/steward.v1.yaml` documents this
  shape on every operation. If server behavior and the spec ever disagree,
  that is a defect in one of them — fix the mismatch, don't let a new
  endpoint skip documenting its real error responses.

## The public contract is load-bearing

[`openapi/steward.v1.yaml`](openapi/steward.v1.yaml) is what a sovereign
customer's own auditor reads to decide whether to trust this service. If you
change request/response shapes, status codes, or add an endpoint, update the
spec in the same change — CI lints it, but lint only catches malformed YAML,
not spec/behavior drift. Read the response your handler actually sends before
declaring the spec update done.

## Computer-use stays out of this process

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#deferred-decision-computer-use-is-a-separate-worker-never-in-process).
Do not add command execution, sandboxing, or any agent-capability code to this
repository's own process, even experimentally. That decision has two
independent reasons (dependency purity, isolation) and both still hold.
