# Build and place an agent

Steward provides one application surface around Hermes and OpenClaw. The agent
runtime still owns its reasoning loop. Steward defines the immutable image,
skills, model route, resources, state, placement, and lifetime that operators can
inspect before granting authority.

This workflow produces portable artifacts. A placement decision does not start a
container or bypass signed admission. The existing tenant-signed command and
Executor checks remain the authority that may admit and start the workload.

## Check this machine

```console
stewardctl agent doctor
```

The report distinguishes `development` from `hardened`. On macOS, Docker Desktop
runs Linux containers in a VM but does not provide Steward's qualified
Docker/gVisor node boundary. Use macOS to author, validate, and test agents; place
sensitive production work on a Linux node that reports `hardened`.

## Create an agent project

```console
mkdir workspace-auditor
stewardctl agent init -runtime hermes -name workspace-auditor workspace-auditor
cd workspace-auditor
```

`Stewardfile.cue` is concrete CUE. Replace the placeholder image with the digest
of the adapter image you built and qualified. Image tags alone are rejected.

Validate and build it:

```console
stewardctl agent validate
stewardctl agent build
```

The bundle contains no API key, connector credential, reusable permit, runtime
reference, or receipt key. Configure model and service secrets through Gateway's
[external materialization boundary]({{ '/guides/secrets/' | relative_url }}).

JSON input is also accepted. The repository includes concrete
[Hermes](https://github.com/hardrails/steward/tree/main/examples/agents/hermes)
and [OpenClaw](https://github.com/hardrails/steward/tree/main/examples/agents/openclaw)
examples for systems that generate configuration programmatically.

## Apply organizational policy

OPA is optional. When supplied, it must return the boolean `true`; denial,
undefined output, malformed output, timeout, or oversized output stops the build.
The OPA bundle digest and query are recorded in the agent bundle.

```console
opa build --bundle ../examples/policy --output policy.tar.gz
stewardctl agent build \
  -policy-bundle policy.tar.gz \
  -policy-query data.steward.agent.allow
```

OPA can reduce what a definition may request. It cannot turn off gVisor, expand
Executor admission, mint credentials, or override Steward's native safety floors.
Carry the CUE and OPA binaries plus the policy bundle into an air-gapped site as
version-pinned, checksummed tools.

## Explain placement

Export or collect a bounded node inventory, then run:

```console
stewardctl agent plan \
  -bundle agent.bundle.json \
  -nodes ../examples/agents/nodes.json \
  -tenant default
```

Steward first rejects nodes that fail tenant, readiness, architecture, isolation,
label, taint, or resource requirements. It then scores eligible nodes using image
and snapshot locality, preferred labels, and current agent count. Node ID breaks
ties, so the same inputs produce the same decision. Every rejection and score
adjustment is returned.

## Fork persistent state

A snapshot is immutable metadata produced by a trusted storage provider. It binds
the state digest to one agent bundle and runtime. Create a fork plan with:

```console
stewardctl agent fork \
  -bundle agent.bundle.json \
  -snapshot snapshot.json \
  -ttl 2h
```

Steward generates a new instance ID and lineage ID. The default expiry action is
`destroy`. A fork never copies credentials, permits, runtime identity, receipt
keys, active network connections, or process memory. Storage cloning and the
subsequent signed admission remain explicit provider and Executor operations.

## What this surface does not do

It is not a visual workflow builder, prompt graph, model server, live-memory
checkpoint system, or general-purpose cluster scheduler. Those capabilities
would enlarge the trusted product without improving Steward's core guarantee:
an untrusted agent receives only explicit, constrained, and reviewable authority.
